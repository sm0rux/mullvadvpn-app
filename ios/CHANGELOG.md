# Changelog
All changes to the software that can be noticed from the users' perspective should have an entry in
this file. Except very minor things that will not affect functionality, such as log message changes
and minor GUI adjustments.

### Format

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Entries should have the imperative form, just like commit messages. Start each entry with words like
add, fix, increase, force etc.. Not added, fixed, increased, forced etc.

Line wrap the file at 100 chars.                                              That is over here -> |

## [2020.5] - 2020-11-04
### Fixed

### Fixed
- Fix the issue when starting the tunnel could take longer than expected due to the app refreshing
  the relay list before connecting.

  time could lead to the revoked key still being used by the tunnel, leaving the tunnel unusable.

### Changed

  active at that time. Before it would always remove it outside the tunnel.
- Turn off WireGuard backend when there are no active network interfaces available. Saves battery.

  the tunnel.
